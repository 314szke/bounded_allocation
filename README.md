# Experiment with the bounded allocation problem

Experiment with integrating prediction information to the online fractional algorithm solving the bounded allocation problem.

## Credits

The base algorithm's description is from Section 13 of the survey *The Design of Competitive Online Algorithms via a Primalâ€“Dual Approach* by Niv Buchbinder and Joseph Naor.

The code was inspired by the work of Christoph Durr and Nguyen Kim Thang. ([code available here](https://webia.lip6.fr/~durrc//packing/))

## Minimum requirements

    python 3.9.1
    matplotlib 3.4.3
